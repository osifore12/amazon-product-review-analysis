# üõí Case Study Overview: Amazon Product Review Analysis
RetailTech Insights, a growing e-commerce analytics company, provides strategic support to sellers on platforms like Amazon. Amid growing competition and the need for enhanced customer understanding, our team was tasked with analysing Amazon product and review data to uncover patterns, evaluate product performance, and draw actionable insights that can help improve marketing, pricing, and engagement strategies.
As a Junior Data Analyst, I conducted an in-depth Excel-based analysis to explore trends in pricing, discounts, ratings, and customer engagement.
## üéØ Objectives
* Identify average discount percentage by product category
* Quantify product listings per category
* Analyse review volume and ratings by category
* Determine top-rated and most-reviewed products
* Compare actual vs. discounted prices across categories
* Assess distribution of product ratings
* Evaluate potential revenue by category
* Bucket products by price ranges
* Explore correlation between discounts and ratings
* Build an interactive dashboard for stakeholders
## üìÅ Dataset Description

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation
Before analysis, the following steps were taken:
1. Converted percentage and price fields to numeric format

   * Rating-discount ratio
   * Price range buckets (e.g., <‚Çπ200, ‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500, >‚Çπ500)
